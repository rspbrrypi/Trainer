# Trainer for Dutch-Turkish
Trainer for learning and remembering Turkish words.
I was learning Turkish at Duolingo but at some point I had troubles remembering new words. 
At Duolingo you can often just gamble the right translation, 
so I was pretty lost everytime I had to come up with the translation myself. 
I made this trainer so I could practise new learnt words without being able to just guess or having to think a very long time.
New words to come soon.
